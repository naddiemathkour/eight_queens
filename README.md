# eight_queens
A couple cool implementations of the 8 Queens problem

Depth Solution:
    - Implements a slightly optimized depth first search for all possible queen combinations
    
    - Chess board is tracked using a 64 bit Long Long integer

    - Queens are placed using bit shift and xor operations, then checked for collision with other queens.
    
    - When a case fails, the current permutation is rejected and the next begins to traverse
    
    - Upon finding a working solution, the value is saved to an array as an integer number and printed after all possible permutations have been tested

Heap Solution:
    - Implements Heap's Algorithm for generating all possible permutations given an array of size k
    
    - As permutations are generated, the board is built using shift and xor operations and then tested for collision
    
    - Permutations are generated by passing an integer array of size K = 8 carrying all sequential digits from 0 through 7
    
    - Each permutation index gets mapped to a bit index in the Long Long integer with the following operations:
        - i * 8 + arr[i]
    
    - Each permutation is then tested for collisions. Successful tests are saved into an array and output after all possible permutations have been tested
